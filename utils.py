"""Shared analysis and plotting utilities for the LABEL-seq MAPK manuscript.

This module is the single place where the project's *conventions* live — score
columns, class definitions, thresholds, colour palettes, protein labels — so
that the figure notebooks (``Annotations.ipynb``, ``DN.ipynb``, ``HSP90i.ipynb``)
contain only the logic specific to each panel.

Design rules, all of them learned the hard way (see
``docs/hsp90_metric_definitions.md`` and ``docs/known_bugs_and_gotchas.md``):

1. **Every threshold is computed per (library, assay, assay_treatment).**
   ``classification_2.5pct`` is computed at that granularity in the scoring
   pipeline, so anything derived from a synonymous-WT percentile must match it.
   Pooling libraries would mix ARAF cterm (DMSO control) with ARAF nterm
   (No_treatment control) — see gotcha G7.

2. **Two scales, never mixed.** *Buffering* is wild-type-relative (built on
   ``average score``, which re-anchors WT to 1.0 within each condition, so the
   global WT shift cancels). *Dependence* is absolute (built on
   ``intercept_0_standard-adjusted score``, which retains it). Function names
   here always say which scale they are on.

3. **MET is displayed as "HGFR"** in every figure. Use :func:`protein_label`
   for any user-visible protein string; never print the raw key.

**Rendering, conventions, and the annotation plumbing.** Most of this module is
plot builders that take already-computed data and turn it into a figure, plus
the shared conventions (palettes, protein order and display names, score column
names, thresholds) and the style/save helpers.

Since 2026-08-14 it also carries the *input paths* and the small annotation
helpers that attach a file to a scored table — :func:`annotation_sources`,
:func:`input_manifest`, :func:`add_structure_annotations`. They live here so
that a notebook can declare and check every file it reads in one place instead
of leaving paths buried in scripts. The rule they do **not** break: no
classification and no statistics live here. Anything that decides what a variant
*is* — a threshold, a class, a test — stays in the notebook, next to the result
it produces.

    because a data unit maps to a different number of inches when the axes spans
    a different x-range (4 bars vs 3) or is squeezed by an outside legend. This
    pins the axes to an explicit inch rectangle and sets ``xlim`` so one
    category is exactly one data unit == ``pitch_in`` inches; a bar drawn at
    ``width=w`` is then always ``w * pitch_in`` inches wide whatever ``n_bars``
    is. That is what lets 4C and 4G show bars of identical width.

    Bars go at integer x positions ``0 .. n_bars-1``. Because the axes is placed
    with ``add_axes``, callers must **not** call ``fig.tight_layout()``;
    ``savefig(bbox_inches="tight")`` is fine — it trims surrounding whitespace

    """Violins per category, optionally with a class strip above and/or points.

    Port of ``scripts/plot_hsp90_score_violin.py`` — 14.5x9.4 in, class-fraction
    strip above the violins at a 1 : 4.5 height ratio so the violins remain the
    dominant element while the composition strip's columns stay locked to the
    violin x-positions.

    One function covers three panels by argument:

    * ``class_frac`` given -> the composition strip is drawn above (Fig 4D, S4A).
    * ``point_overlay`` given -> per-group medians are scattered as open
      circles over the violins, the check that a pooled signal is not a
      composition artifact (Fig S3B).
    * ``marker_values`` given -> a horizontal dash per category, used for the
      wild-type value on the dependence panel (Fig 4B).

    Args:
        groups: Ordered mapping of category -> values.
        class_frac: Rows indexed by the same categories, columns the classes.
        point_overlay: Long frame from which per-(group, category) medians are
            taken, using ``overlay_value_col`` and ``overlay_group_col``.
        marker_values: category -> value for the wild-type marker.
        marker_style: ``"dash"`` for a horizontal line spanning the slot, or
            ``"star"`` for the open star used by the fractional-change panel.
        tiers: ``(caption, [category, ...])`` groups, drawn with a bold coloured
            caption above the panel and a faint divider between groups — used
            when the categories are themselves grouped (the WT HSP90
            dependence tiers).
        tier_colors: caption -> colour, so a caption can be matched to the
            violin fills it describes.
        y_percent: Format the y-axis ticks as percentages.
        ref_color / ref_ls / ref_lw: Style of the ``ref_line``.
        tight_layout: Call ``fig.tight_layout()`` at the end. Only safe on the
            single-axes form — the strip form places its axes explicitly.
        title_pad: Padding for the title, in points.
        fs: Font-size overrides; keys ``tick``, ``axis``, ``legend``, ``title``.

    """Paired control/HSP90i score violins under a composition heatmap.

    Verbatim port of ``plot_violin`` in
    ``scripts/plot_hsp90_score_violin_all_missense.py`` (the generalised
    sibling of ``plot_hsp90_score_violin.py``, which hard-codes what this one
    derives from ``groups``). Used for both 4D and S4A, which differ only in
    cohort, figure size and tick label.

    The figure is two stacked axes sharing x, so the heatmap's column centres
    are locked to the violins' protein positions. Per protein there are two
    violins — control on the left in the tier colour, HSP90i on the right in a
    55% lightened version, so treatment reads as shade and dependence tier as
    hue. Two annotations sit on each violin:

    * a **hatched sub-polygon** covering the part of the violin below that
      cell's synonymous-WT 2.5th-percentile threshold, clipped out of the drawn
      polygon itself rather than drawn as a band, so the textured area is
      literally the "low"-classified mass;
    * a **horizontal WT line** spanning the violin's true lateral extent at the
      wild-type score, interpolated from the body polygon so it shrinks in the
      tails instead of overhanging.

    The WT line is what makes the panel readable: a distribution sitting far
    from zero but on top of its own WT dash has no variant-specific effect.

    Args:
        arrays: ``(protein, {"ctrl"|"hsp90i"}) -> scores`` in linear units;
            log10 is taken here.
        wt: ``(protein, treatment) -> wild-type score``, linear units.
        thresholds: ``(protein, treatment) -> low cutoff``, linear units.
        heatmap: ``protein -> {row_key: fraction}``, plus ``_n`` for the tick
            label. Non-finite cells are left blank.
        trim_pct: Percentile window each series is trimmed to *before* the KDE
            is computed, e.g. ``(1, 99)``. ``violinplot`` evaluates its kernel
            over the full min-to-max of the data, so a handful of extreme
            variants drags a thin sliver of density out across the panel and
            every violin reads as long-tailed. Trimming bounds the drawn support
            to the bulk. Note the consequence: the hatched "low" region is
            derived from the drawn polygon, so trimming makes it a qualitative
            marker of where the threshold cuts rather than a faithful area — the
            exact fractions are in the heatmap above. ``None`` keeps the full
            range.
        ylim_pct: Percentiles of the pooled data setting the y-range.
        groups: ``(tier label, [protein, ...])`` left to right. Tier dividers,
            heatmap group gaps and the tier captions are all derived from this.
        group_fill: tier label -> colour.
        heatmap_rows: Row keys top to bottom; the first ``n_standard_rows`` are
            bracketed as the absolute scale and the rest as WT-relative.
        fs: Font-size overrides; keys ``xtick``, ``ytick``, ``ylabel``,
            ``cell``, ``row``, ``bracket``, ``group``, ``legend``.

    Port of ``plot_donut`` in ``scripts/plot_hsp90_client_donut.py``. The outer
    ring is drawn first so the inner ring's white edge sits cleanly on top of
    it. Outer labels go at ``outer_label_r``; inner labels sit at the inner
    band's mid-radius, rotated *tangentially* (long axis along the arc) and
    flipped in the lower half so they never read upside-down.

    Ring alignment is the caller's job: pass outer sizes that already sum,
    within each group, to that group's inner-ring span, so the two rings are
    concentric. The notebook does that arithmetic — see Fig 4A.

    Args:
        outer_sizes: Angular size per outer slice, in the drawing order.
        outer_colors: One colour per outer slice.
        outer_labels: One label per outer slice (``""`` to leave a slice bare).

    """Binned fraction-in-class profiles over predictors, with count strips.

    Verbatim port of ``plot_global`` / ``plot_per_protein`` in
    ``scripts/plot_hsp90_univariate_simplified_definitions.py``. One column per
    predictor; each cell is a profile over uniform-width bins with a grey
    per-bin count strip beneath it sharing the x-axis. The strip is what makes
    the profile honest — a fraction from a bin holding twelve variants looks
    identical to one from twelve hundred until you can see the n.

    Bins are uniform width rather than quantile: the *shape* of the
    relationship is the finding (the ddG profile is an inverted U), and quantile
    bins would flatten it.

    Args:
        profiles: ``(protein_or_None, predictor_col) -> frame`` with columns
            ``bin_center``, ``n`` and ``frac_<key>`` per category. Empty frames
            hide their cell.
        edges: predictor column -> bin edges, shared down a column so panels
            align horizontally.
        predictors: One mapping per column with ``col``, ``label`` keys.
        categories: ``(key, label, colour)`` per line, in legend order.
        proteins: One row per protein for the per-protein grid; empty gives the
            single pooled row with a legend in the first panel.
        row_ylabel_fmt: Row label for the per-protein grid; ``{label}`` is the
            display name.
        fs: Font-size overrides; keys ``axis``, ``tick``, ``hist_axis``,

    N-terminus on the left, three discrete rows (Mis on top, Del, Non) spaced
    ``col_width`` apart, domains as vertical shaded bands spanning all rows
    with bold labels above, row labels at the left, and a small y-jitter so
    variants at the same position do not completely overlap.

    Dots default to 26 pt^2 rather than the original 14 so they read at panel
    size; pass ``dot_size`` to change it.

    The axes are placed by ``subplots_adjust``, not ``tight_layout``, and the
    original saves **without** ``bbox_inches="tight"`` so every protein's panel
    comes out at identical dimensions and can be stacked. Use
    ``save_figure(..., tight=False)`` to preserve that.

    Args:
        positions_by_type: variant type -> residue positions carrying a DN.
        xlim: ``(first, last)`` residue of the profiled window. Trimming to the
            scanned region rather than the full protein keeps the density
            honest.
        domains: ``(name, start, end, colour)`` shaded bands.
        text_only_domains: ``(name, position)`` italic grey motif labels.
        dot_size: Scatter point area.
        margins: Overrides for ``subplots_adjust``; defaults to the locked
            ``left=0.06, right=0.99, top=0.78, bottom=0.32``.

    """Activity histogram with the DN threshold and control boxplots beneath.

    New panel (no prior version). Variants below ``dn_threshold`` are drawn in
    the DN colour, the rest dark; a dotted line marks the threshold. Bin edges
    are split exactly at the threshold so the coloured block ends there rather
    than at the nearest bin boundary.

    ``box_distributions`` is a sequence of ``(label, five_number, colour)``
    drawn top-to-bottom in the lower strip on the shared x-axis. The
    five-number mapping uses keys ``p2.5``, ``p25``, ``median``, ``p75``,
    ``p97.5``; missing quartiles collapse the box to a line rather than
    failing, so a distribution known only by its outer percentiles still
    renders.

    ``groups`` switches the bars from DN-vs-not colouring to a **stacked**
    histogram of variant classes, given as ``(label, values, colour)``. The
    threshold line and its annotation stay, and the region below the threshold
    is shaded, so which variants are DN is still readable — but the panel now
    also answers *what kind* of variant sits where on the activity axis, which
    the two-colour version could not. ``scores`` should be the concatenation of
    the group values; it is what the smoothed curve and the counts describe.

    ``density_groups`` takes the same ``(label, values, colour)`` shape but
    replaces the bars with one **area-normalised** smoothed density per class.
    Use it to compare where classes sit on the activity axis: stacked counts are
    dominated by whichever class is most numerous, so a class an order of
    magnitude rarer is invisible. The trade is that the curves no longer carry
    abundance, so class sizes are put in the legend and the per-class fraction
    below the threshold is annotated instead.

    ``smooth`` overlays a Gaussian KDE scaled to counts. It is fitted in the
    axis's own space — log10 when ``log_x``, linear otherwise — so the curve is
    not distorted by the transform. Scaling uses a *uniform* bin width in that
    space rather than the actual (threshold-split, possibly uneven) edges, so
    the curve's area matches the histogram's regardless of where the split
    lands.

    Args:
        scores: Values to histogram.
        dn_threshold: Empty-vector cutoff on the same scale.
        box_distributions: Control distributions for the lower strip.
        groups: ``(label, values, colour)`` per variant class, stacked.
        smooth: Overlay a count-scaled KDE.
        smooth_bw: Bandwidth passed to ``gaussian_kde`` (default: Scott's rule).
        note: Small grey caption, e.g. to record a missing input.
        fs: Font-size overrides; keys ``axis``, ``tick``, ``ann``, ``title``.

    Verbatim port of ``build_figure`` and ``draw_pooled_brackets`` from
    ``scripts/plot_class_depletion_heatmap.py`` — the drawing is unchanged so
    the panel is identical to the published figure. Only the inputs differ:
    the class/database definitions, the column order and the between-class
    statistics are computed in the notebook and passed in, so no analysis
    happens here.

    Placement is deliberately staged and order-dependent. The axes is
    aspect-equal, so its realised rectangle is only known after
    ``fig.canvas.draw()``; the colourbar and significance key are then placed
    against that realised right edge, which is why they sit snug regardless of
    how far the bracket ladder extends the x-range.

    Args:
        lut: ``(scope, database, class) -> (odds_ratio, q, n_total)``. Missing
            keys, ``n_total == 0`` and non-finite odds ratios all render as
            no-data grey.
        groups: ``(database, [class, ...])`` top to bottom. Blocks may differ
            in length — GENIE has no nonsense classes because stop-gains have
            no cancer observations.
        class_labels: class key -> row label.
        col_order: scope columns left to right; ``pooled_key`` is appended
            after a gap and its tick label is bolded.
        pairwise: between-class tests with ``database``, ``class_a``,
            ``class_b``, ``q``. Significant pairs get a bracket in packed lanes
            right of the pooled column; ns pairs are omitted. None skips them.
        genie_min_count: tumour-count threshold, for the GENIE super-label.
        cbar_dy: Raise the colourbar (and so its rotated label) by this
            fraction of the figure height. The bar is bottom-aligned with the
            heatmap, which puts a long label hard against the bottom edge where
            a tight bbox can clip it.
        cbar_h_frac: Colourbar height as a fraction of the heatmap height.

    """Render a structure with per-residue spheres and/or a colour ramp.

    The one structure renderer. It writes a ``.pml`` and then invokes PyMOL on
    it, so the exact commands stay inspectable and re-runnable outside the
    notebook.

    Two channels, independent and combinable:

    * ``sphere_counts`` -> C-alpha spheres whose VDW radius is a **linear,
      absolute** function of the count (``count_range`` mapped onto
      ``radius_range``, saturating above). Absolute rather than per-structure
      normalisation is what lets one legend serve every render.
    * ``residue_values`` -> the cartoon coloured by a value in
      ``[vmin, vmax]`` through ``cmap``, with unmeasured residues in
      ``nodata_color`` (mid-grey, so it is distinguishable from the white end
      of the ramp).

    **Constant scale, varying canvas.** For the sphere legend to be honest, a
    3.5 A sphere must occupy the same number of page pixels in every panel. The
    camera is therefore zoomed to fit the molecule and the image is then sized
    at ``px_per_angstrom`` pixels per Angstrom of molecular extent — so a large
    protein yields a physically larger image rather than being shrunk to a
    common frame. Panels will not all be the same dimensions, and will not
    match renders made with a fixed image size.

    Args:
        out_stem: Output path without extension; ``.pml``, ``.png`` and
            optionally ``.pse`` are written beside it.
        structure: ``"fetch:9AXM"`` for a PDB ID, else a path to a local file.
            Fetches use the asymmetric unit, which preserves the deposited
            chain IDs — the biological assembly renames them and silently
            produced a blank ARAF render once.
        partners: Either ``(chain, label, colour)`` or a mapping with those
            keys plus optional ``sphere_counts`` / ``sphere_color``. Shown as
            sticks for a short peptide, cartoon otherwise. Giving a partner its
            own spheres is how a two-chain panel shows DNs on both sides: each
            chain keeps its own cartoon colour and its own sphere colour, so
            which protein a sphere belongs to is unambiguous.
        ligands: Residue names to draw from the query chains, e.g.
            ``("ATP", "MG")``. Polyatomic ligands are drawn as sticks with
            carbons in ``ligand_color`` and other elements by element; single
            atoms (metals, halides) are drawn as small spheres in
            ``ligand_color``. Nothing is shown by default: a deposited ligand is
            loaded but invisible unless asked for, which is how MET's bound
            ATP went unrendered.
        graft: Borrow a chain from a SECOND structure and show it in this one's
            frame, for when the ligand-bound structure covers only part of the
            protein. Keys: ``structure``, ``align_resi`` (the residue range
            shared by both, used for the superposition), ``keep_chain``,
            ``label``, ``color``, and optional ``align_chain`` (default "A").
            The donor is superposed onto the query over ``align_resi``, then
            everything but ``keep_chain`` is discarded. Caveat worth stating in
            any caption: donor and query are different conformations, so a
            grafted ligand marks *where* a site is rather than reproducing that
            complex's geometry exactly.
        ligand_color: Carbon / ion colour for ``ligands``. Chosen to contrast
            with both the grey cartoon and the per-protein DN spheres.
        ion_vdw: Sphere radius for single-atom ligands. Deliberately distinct
            from ``radius_range`` so an ion is not misread as a DN sphere; the
            colour is the primary cue.
        view: 18-tuple from PyMOL's ``get_view``. Its **orientation and
            centring** are honoured exactly; its zoom is refit to the molecule
            so nothing is cropped, since the view's own field of view trims
            anything taller than it and enlarging the image at a fixed field of
            view would change the scale rather than reveal more. Without a view the camera is zoomed to fit and
            the canvas sized from the molecular extent; both routes land on the
            same scale, which is what makes one sphere legend valid throughout.
        align_to / align_chain / align_resi / align_rotations: Superpose onto
            an anchor so several proteins share a frame. The rotations are
            applied to the **anchor's atoms** before superposition — order
            matters, because ``cmd.rotate(axis, angle, selection)`` moves only
            that selection, so rotating afterwards would leave the subject
            behind.
        px_per_angstrom: Pixels per Angstrom. Constant across panels — this is
            what the shared sphere legend rests on.
        pad_angstrom: Clear space beyond the ink, in Angstroms.
        cartoon_pad_angstrom: Allowance for the cartoon ribbon, which is drawn
            around the backbone and so reaches past every atom centre. Added to
            ``pad_angstrom`` together with the largest sphere radius.
        max_px: Cap on either image dimension, to bound ray-trace time.
        run: Execute PyMOL. False writes the ``.pml`` only.

    Returns:
        Path to the written ``.pml``.
